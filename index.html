                <p class="lyricityPar">This is Lyricity. My team and I created a web lyrics app that allows
                    a user to
                    search for a song that they want to know the lyrics to. If the song is in our database it will
                    generate
                    the lyrics and album cover if available. The user can then favorite that song to save it to their
                    favorites. On the left hand side of the page the user will find a favorites button. When they click
                    on this it will open their favorites tab allowing them to view and revisit their favorited songs or
                    clear their favorites in case they are wanting a new list. If the song is not in our database the
                    user
                    will be greeted with an inspiring Kanye
                    quote and Kanye picture. Future developments include the ability to play music, styled lyrics,
                    ability to create and save music to a playlist.

                <p class="codeQPar">This is Coding Quiz. I created this web app for my Coding Bootcamp homework. This
                    web app allows the user to start a timed and scored coding quiz. The quiz has a series of 5 multiple
                    choice questions. The user has 100 seconds to complete these 5 coding questions. As they answer the
                    questions if they get the answer wrong it will display the correct answer below the next question.
                    Once the user reaches the end of the quiz they will see their final score which is based off the
                    time remaining. They are then asked to enter their initials to save their score in the high score
                    page. It will also display how many they got correct. Once they submit their score they will be
                    directed to the high score page which will display all logged scores. Future developments include
                    the web app having quizs for multiple languages as well as lessons on languages that users can use
                    to learn how to code and create web apps. Also will save users progress, allow them to have profiles
                    where they save their languages they are learning, projects they have made and a play ground for
                    users to practice.
